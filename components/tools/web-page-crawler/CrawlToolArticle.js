        A web crawler online plays a significant role in indexing web pages.
        This positively boosts your SEO ranking visibility as well as
        conversions. Let’s understand how this crawler works and its benefits.
      </p>
      <h3 className="color-brand-1 mb-20">What is a Web Crawler Bot?</h3>
      <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
        A web crawler bot, also known as a spider or search engine bot,
        systematically downloads and indexes content from across the internet.
        Operated mainly by search engines, these bots aim to comprehend the
        content of almost every web page. It therefore allows search algorithms
        to generate relevant links in response to user queries.
      </p>
      <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
        Think of a web crawler as organizing a disorganized library, creating a
        card catalog by reading titles, summaries, and internal text to
        categorize and sort books by topics. This makes information easily
        accessible to visitors. However, unlike a library, the internet’s lack
        of physical makes it challenging to ensure proper indexing, leading
        webpage crawlers to start with known pages and follow hyperlinks to
        discover additional information.
      </p>
      <h3 className="color-brand-1 mb-20">How Does Web Crawling Work?</h3>
      <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
        Search indexing and web crawlers, operated by search engines, work
        hand-in-hand to navigate the dynamic internet landscape. Beginning with
        a seed list of URLs, web crawlers expand their reach by crawling pages
        and following hyperlinks. Selective policies prioritize URL crawling
        based on factors like link count and visitor traffic, akin to a library
        emphasizing popular books for indexing.
      </p>
      <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
        Web crawlers revisit pages periodically to capture updated content in
        the ever-changing online environment. Adhering to robots.txt protocols,
        they follow rules specified by a web page’s server, determining which
        pages to crawl and links to follow. This intricate process ensures the
        download and indexing of relevant content from web pages, aligning with
        the shared goal of enhancing search engine functionality.
