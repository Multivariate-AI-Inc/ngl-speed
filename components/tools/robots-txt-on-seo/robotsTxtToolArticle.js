          A robots.txt file is a crucial element of technical search engine
          optimization (SEO). Every website needs a robots.txt file as it gives
          you more control over the search engine's movement on your website.
          So, let’s understand the significance of this file and its best
          practices.

          <b> Explain Robots.txt File </b>
        </h2>
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          Robots.txt is a text document generated by website publishers and
          stored at the root of their website. Its primary purpose is to
          instruct automated web crawlers, such as search engine bots, regarding
          which pages to avoid crawling on the website. This is commonly known
          as the robot exclusion protocol (REP). The REP also includes
          directives like meta robots, page-subdirectory-, or site-wide
          information for how search engines should treat links like “follow”
          and “nofollow.”
        </p>
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          {" "}
          It should be noted that the presence of robots.txt does not assure
          that the URLs marked for exclusion won’t be indexed for search. This
          is because search engine crawlers or spiders may still discover the
          existence of these pages through links on other web pages or from
          previous indexing activities.  A Robots.txt file is publicly
          accessible. Simply appending /robots.txt to a domain URL allows anyone
          to view its robots.txt file. Therefore, it’s advisable to not include
          files or directories containing sensitive information. Additionally,
          relying solely on this file is not recommended for protecting private
          or confidential data from search engines.

          is particularly useful in various scenarios, including:{" "}

        <h2 className="color-brand-1 mb-25 mt-10">
          <b> Format of Robots.txt File </b>
        </h2>
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          The fundamental structure of a simple robots.txt file is as follows:
        </p>
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          User-agent: [user-agent name]Disallow: [URL string not to be crawled]
        </p>
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          This pair of lines contributes to the complete robots.txt file.
          However, a single robots.txt file may consist of multiple lines
          featuring various user agents and directives, such as disallow, allow,
          and crawl-delays, among others. In a robots.txt document, each
          grouping of user-agent directives is distinct, with each set separated
          by a line break.
        </p>
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          In a robots.txt file encompassing multiple user-agent directives, each
          disallow or allow rule exclusively pertains to the user-agent(s)
          specified in that specific line break-separated set. If the file
          contains a rule applicable to more than one user-agent, a crawler will
          adhere solely to the most specific set of instructions, following the
          directives outlined therein.
        </p>
        <h2 className="color-brand-1 mb-25 mt-10">
          <b> Where Does Robots.txt Go on a Site?</b>
        </h2>
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          When search engines and other web-crawling robots, such as Facebook’s
          Facebot, visit a site, they automatically look for the robots.txt
          file. However, they specifically look for this file in one location-
          the main directory, typically the root domain or homepage.
        </p>
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          For example, if a user agent checks “www.example.com/robots.txt” and
          does not locate a robots file, it assumes the site lacks one and
          proceeds to crawl all content on the page, potentially even the entire
          site.
        </p>
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          Even if the robots txt page exists at alternative locations like
          “example.com/index/robots.txt” or
          “www.example.com/homepage/robots.txt,” user agents won’t discover it,
          treating the site as if it has no robots file at all. To ensure the
          robots.txt file is easily found, it should always be placed in the
          main directory or root domain.
        </p>
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          Moreover, robots.txt is case sensitive due to which the file must be
          named “robots.txt” and not Robots.txt or robots.TXT, or any other
          formats. Some user agents (robots) may opt to disregard your
          robots.txt file, particularly more malicious crawlers like malware
          robots or email address scrapers.
        </p>
        <h2 className="color-brand-1 mb-25 mt-10">
          <b> How Does Robots.txt Work?</b>
        </h2>{" "}
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          The two primary tasks of search engines are:{" "}
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          <b>Crawling the Web:</b> This involves discovering content by
          following links across billions of websites. This process, often
          referred to as “spidering,” is crucial for search engines to navigate
          the vast web
        </p>
        .{" "}
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          <b>Indexing Content:</b> Once crawled, the content is indexed to make
          it accessible to users seeking information.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          When a search crawler reaches a website, it checks for a robots.txt
          file before proceeding with spidering. If found, the crawler reads the
          file first, as it contains instructions on how the search engine
          should crawl the site. The directives in the robots.txt file guide the
          crawler’s actions on that specific site. If the file doesn’t contain
          any directives that restrict a user-agents activity, or if the site
          lacks a robots.txt file, the crawler proceeds to crawl other
          information on that site.

        <h2 className="color-brand-1 mb-25 mt-10">
          <b> Technical Robots.txt Syntax</b>
        </h2>
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          You can think of robots.txt syntax as the language of robots.txt
          files. Check out these five common terms that you would come across in
          such a file:
        </p>
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          <b> User-agent:</b> This is the specific web crawler to which you are
          giving crawl instructions which is usually a search engine.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          <b> Disallow:</b>
          This command tells a user agent not to crawl a particular URL. Only
          one “Disallow:” line is allowed for each URL.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          <b> Allow:</b> This command is only applicable to Googlebot. It tells
          the bot that it can access a page or subfolder even though its parent
          page or subfolder is disallowed.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          <b>Crawl-delay:</b> This conveys the number of seconds a crawler
          should wait before loading and crawling page content. Although Google
          bot does not acknowledge this command, you can set a crawl rate in
          Google Search Console.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          <b>Sitemap:</b> This command can be used to call out the location of
          any XML sitemap(s) associated with this URL. It is only supported by
          Google, Yahoo, Bing, and Ask.
        </p>{" "}
        <p className="font-md color-grey-400 mb-20">
          <b> Pattern Matching:</b> When it comes to the actual URLs to allow or
          block, robots.txt can be complex as they use pattern-matching to cover
          a wide range of possibilities when it comes to URL options. Google and
          Bing allow two regular expressions that can be used to identify pages
          or sub-folders that an SEO wants to be excluded.

          Every website should include a robots.txt file, even if it is blank.

          first thing they look for is this file. If no robots.txt file exists
          on your website, then the spiders are served a 404 (not found) error.
          Although Google states Googlebot can go on and crawl the site even if
          there is no robots.txt file, it is recommended to have this file that
          the bot requests rather than produce an error file.
